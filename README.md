DotNet Prism
============

A C# project implements a very simple calculator in order to demonstrate writing 
a [PRISM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg406140.aspx) application.

To extract this project at different stage of development, use the following [GIT branches](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging):
* step-1 - pre-Unity, pre-PRISM

For example, run the command `git checkout -f step-1` to switch to step 1
